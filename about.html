						<h3>Comfort</h3>
						<p>
							We are a small firm located in my parentâ€™s basement. It has been renovated to offer the most ergonomic work environment possible. We have a mini fridge dedicated to Mountain Dew Code Red and every work station comes standard with a large container of Cheesy Poofs. The work environment also has an on-duty comfort plant named Steve 2 (Steve one had an unfortunate accident involving our not watering him and his not being a cactus). Steve 2 is made from the finest plastics and offers a soothing scent of the surrounding room.

						<h3>Technology</h3>
						<p>
							We focus on using the most up to date technologies. Our state-of-the-art sound system continuously plays music designed to focus the mind. It also sounds sick when we have our weekly office movie night. Other technological advances that make our product stand near the rest, is the top of the line rgb throught the room that works in synch with the sound system to really focus the minds of our employees.

						<p>
							Finally, at SubPar designs we are focused on teamwork. We have mandatory LAN parties every week. All persons must participate in a R&R weekend once a month. We also compete in team building exercises through the medium of Fortnight. Our team is a dedicated unit with the drive and motivation to finish projects quickly. Our promise is to finish the projects we start. If ever we fail to live up to that promise, we reimburse our customers 100% of half of the cost. With the greatest in comfort, technology, and teamwork, SubPar Designs is guaranteed to be a web development firm.
